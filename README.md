# Bank or Financial Controlling System in Java
A simple Java program that allows the client to add their name, type of account and balance, then do operations like transferring the money, adding more money to the account and checking the balance. Done mostly so I can start to get java's logic better, as I'll have to use it both in college and at my job. 

## What I learned
- Fixated Java logics
- Better understanding of loops
- Better understanding of user inputs
